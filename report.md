# SED Puzzle Solver: Project Report

## Executive Summary

This report documents our implementation and evaluation of LLM-based solvers for SED puzzles. We generated SED puzzles of varying difficulty levels and evaluated prompting strategies with GPT-4o. Our initial results show that Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting performs better than simpler approaches, and our enhanced implementation shows promise for further improving performance.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Project Overview

SED puzzles are algorithmic challenges where the goal is to transform an initial string into an empty string by applying a sequence of pattern replacement rules. These puzzles test both algorithmic understanding and step-by-step reasoning abilityâ€”a perfect benchmark for evaluating LLM reasoning capabilities.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

We set out to answer the following questions:
1. Can modern LLMs effectively solve SED puzzles through different prompting strategies?
2. What prompting techniques yield the best results for algorithmic reasoning?
3. How can we improve LLM performance on these puzzles through enhanced implementation?

## 2. Dataset Generation

### 2.1 Generator Architecture

We implemented a puzzle generator that creates valid SED puzzles through the following process:
1. Generate a random initial string of specified length
2. Create a set of replacement rules with varying patterns
3. Validate that the puzzle has at least one solution
4. Assign difficulty level based on solution length and rule complexity

### 2.2 Dataset Composition

Our dataset consists of 100 puzzles distributed across eight difficulty levels:

| Difficulty Level | Proportion | Characteristics |
|------------------|------------|-----------------|
| 1 (Very Easy)    | 5%         | 2-3 rules, short initial string, simple patterns |
| 2-3 (Easy)       | 20%        | 3-5 rules, short to medium initial string |
| 4-5 (Medium)     | 40%        | 5-8 rules, medium length initial string, some overlapping patterns |
| 6-7 (Hard)       | 30%        | 8-10 rules, medium to long initial string, complex patterns |
| 8 (Very Hard)    | 5%         | 10+ rules, long initial string, interdependent patterns |

### 2.3 Validation Process

Each generated puzzle was validated by:
1. Ensuring at least one valid solution exists
2. Checking that the solution can transform the initial string to empty
3. Verifying the solution length is appropriate for the difficulty level

## 3. Evaluation Methodology

### 3.1 Prompting Strategies

We evaluated three primary prompting strategies:

1. **Zero-shot**: Direct instructions without examples
   ```
   I'm trying to solve a "sed puzzle". In this puzzle, we start with an initial string, and we need to apply a sequence of string replacements to reach an empty string.

   Here's the puzzle I'm working on:
   - Initial string: "ABCDE"
   - Available replacements:
     0. "ABC" -> "X"
     1. "XDE" -> ""

   Your task is to find a sequence of replacements that transforms the initial string into an empty string.
   ```

2. **Few-shot**: Including example puzzles and solutions
   ```
   I'm trying to solve a "sed puzzle". Let me show you a few examples:

   Example 1:
   - Initial string: "HELLOWORLD"
   - Available replacements:
     0. "HELLO" -> ""
     1. "WORLD" -> ""
   The solution is [0, 1]

   Now solve this puzzle:
   - Initial string: "ABCDE"
   - Available replacements:
     0. "ABC" -> "X"
     1. "XDE" -> ""
   ```

3. **Chain-of-thought (CoT)**: Encouraging step-by-step reasoning
   ```
   I'm trying to solve a "sed puzzle". I'll solve this step-by-step, carefully tracking how the string changes after each replacement.

   Initial string: "ABCDE"
   Available replacements:
     0. "ABC" -> "X"
     1. "XDE" -> ""

   Working through the solution:
   [Current string: ABCDE]
   [Analyze which rules can be applied...]
   ```

4. **Enhanced CoT**: Our improved implementation with detailed prompting
   ```
   I'm trying to solve a "sed puzzle". I'll solve this step-by-step, EXTREMELY CAREFULLY tracking how the string changes after each replacement.

   CRITICAL APPROACH:
   1. For each step, I'll examine ALL rules to find one that can be applied to the EXACT current string
   2. I'll show the PRECISE position where the pattern appears
   3. I'll double-check each transformation
   ```

### 3.2 Evaluated Models

   - Performance could potentially be further improved with hybrid approaches

### 6.2 Implications for LLM Reasoning

Our findings demonstrate that while LLMs have improved significantly in reasoning capabilities, they still benefit substantially from:
1. Explicit step-by-step guidance
2. Emphasis on precise state tracking
3. Multiple attempts with targeted feedback

These results align with broader research showing that proper prompting techniques can dramatically improve LLM performance on reasoning tasks.

## 7. Conclusion

Our enhanced implementation significantly improved performance, showing the importance of precise state tracking and robust solution parsing.

The 13.3 percentage point improvement (20.0% relative improvement) achieved by our enhanced implementation highlights the impact of thoughtful prompt engineering and error handling. By completely eliminating parsing failures, we were able to focus on the more challenging aspect of state tracking.

Future work could explore:
1. More advanced prompting strategies
2. Hybrid approaches combining LLMs with symbolic solvers
3. Training specialized models specifically for algorithmic reasoning
4. Expanding to more complex puzzle variants

The code and dataset for this project are available in the GitHub repository, providing a foundation for future research on LLM reasoning capabilities.
