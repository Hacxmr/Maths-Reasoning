## Recommendations

### Key Focus Areas for Improvement

1. **Enhance Output Format Instructions**
   - Make output format requirements more prominent in prompts
   - Add explicit examples of correctly formatted solutions
   - Implement more robust parsing of model outputs

The **chain_of_thought** prompting strategy shows the best performance with a 100.0% success rate and should be prioritized.

The retry mechanism improved success rates by an average of 20.0%. This substantial improvement suggests that further refining the retry feedback could yield even better results.
